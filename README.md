# Project: Village East App

This is a security-focused village management app developed as part of my self-study in programming and my goal to contribute meaningfully to the community. It was inspired by real incidents in our neighborhood ‚Äî including theft, carnapping, and the shocking discovery of a drug lab inside the village.

The app replaces the manual ID-check system (which relies on rarely-reviewed CCTV footage) with a **QR code-based visitor logging system**, enabling real-time accountability and secure data handling.

While I‚Äôm continuing to build this in collaboration with the village council, all code, design, and logic were implemented by me using modern frontend technologies.
