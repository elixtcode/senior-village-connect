# Project: Village East App

This is a security-focused village management app I developed as part of my self-study in programming and my goal to apply technology meaningfully to real-world problems. The project was inspired by serious incidents in our community‚Äîincluding theft, carnapping, and the shocking discovery of a drug lab inside the village.

The app is currently in its **prototype phase** and under collaborative development with the village council. It replaces the manual ID-check system with a **QR code-based visitor logging system**, aiming to enable real-time accountability and secure data handling.

The initial layout was scaffolded using an AI-assisted tool, but all core logic, components, and styling were manually implemented and customized by me using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This prototype demonstrates my ability to build a functional frontend application and translate real community needs into purposeful code.

## Key Features (Prototype Phase)

- Prototype of a QR-based visitor check-in and logging system
- Initial screens for resident activity logs and association dues tracking
- Clean, readable UI designed with elderly users in mind
- Optimized for mobile users, especially Filipinos without access to laptops
- Password-free access model tailored for seniors (OTP planned)
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS and React
- QR code logic built with React hooks and typed data structures

## What I Learned

This community-driven project helped me grow in the following areas:

- Designing for real-world constraints, including accessibility and security  
- Managing application state, conditional rendering, and form logic using TypeScript and React  
- Building a scalable frontend architecture with modular components  
- Collaborating with stakeholders and adapting based on real-world feedback  
- Handling user flows that reflect local context and behavioral patterns

## Project Highlights

- Designed to replace passive CCTV reliance with proactive QR-based visitor tracking
- Built reusable UI components using shadcn/ui
- Designed for password-free authentication and planned future OTP support  
- Demonstrated how tech can address overlooked local safety issues  
- Used AI-assisted scaffolding during early layout setup only; all code and logic written manually
