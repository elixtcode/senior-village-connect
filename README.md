# 🛡️ Project: Village East App

This is a security-focused village management app I developed as part of my self-study in programming and my goal to apply technology meaningfully to real-world problems. The project was inspired by serious incidents in our community—including theft, carnapping, and the discovery of a drug lab inside the village—highlighting the need for better visitor monitoring and accountability.

The app replaces the manual ID-check process (which relied on rarely-reviewed CCTV footage) with a **QR code-based visitor logging system**, enabling real-time tracking and secure data handling.

All logic, code, and design decisions were implemented by me using modern frontend tools. While the app is still evolving through collaboration with the village council, this version was fully developed independently and demonstrates my ability to design practical, community-centered solutions.

> This project allowed me to apply TypeScript and React fundamentals—including typed state management, reusable components, and real-time interaction logic—in a real-world, security-critical context.
